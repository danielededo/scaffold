# scaffold

A meta/template repository with a sensible baseline for personal projects — licensing, governance, documentation, and contribution workflow. It is deliberately **not** language-specific: it contains the parts that every project needs regardless of stack.

## What this repo is

This repository is a starting point for new personal projects, both public and private. It collects the boilerplate that is easy to get wrong or to postpone forever:

- License texts and a guide for choosing between them
- Community and governance files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`)
- A changelog skeleton following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Documentation on branching strategies, commit conventions, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- GitHub-specific configuration (issue and PR templates, `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot)
- Cross-language editor, line-ending, and ignore rules (`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`)
- A checklist for the GitHub settings that files can't carry ([docs/REPO-SETTINGS.md](docs/REPO-SETTINGS.md))

[TO BE FILLED IN: anything else this template grows to include]

## How to use it as a template

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub (or clone and re-init: `git clone`, delete `.git`, `git init`).
2. Search for the placeholders and replace them:
   - `<PROJECT_NAME>` — the name of your new project
   - `<OWNER_HANDLE>` — your GitHub username
   - `<SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL>` — the address for vulnerability reports
   - `<CONTACT_EMAIL>` — the code of conduct enforcement contact
   - `<YEAR>` / `<COPYRIGHT_HOLDER>` — in the chosen license file
   - `[TO BE FILLED IN]` — free-form sections that need project-specific content
3. Pick a license: read [docs/LICENSE-GUIDE.md](docs/LICENSE-GUIDE.md), copy the right file from [licenses/](licenses/) to the repository root as `LICENSE`, and delete the `licenses/` directory.
4. Rewrite this `README.md` for the actual project, starting from
   [docs/README-TEMPLATE.md](docs/README-TEMPLATE.md).
5. Configure the repository settings following [docs/REPO-SETTINGS.md](docs/REPO-SETTINGS.md).
6. Delete what you don't need (see the notes below on optional files).
7. Reset `CHANGELOG.md` to a fresh `Unreleased` section.

### Optional files

- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** — included because it is useful the moment a public project receives external contributors, but it is optional: feel free to remove it for private or strictly personal repositories.
- **`.github/CODEOWNERS`** — optional for single-maintainer projects; see the comments inside the file.
- **`docs/adr/`** — keep it only if you intend to record architecture decisions.

## What it does NOT include (and why)

- **Language-specific tooling** (linters, formatters, build files, package manifests): every stack has its own conventions and generators; duplicating them here would only go stale.
- **CI/CD workflows**: pipelines depend heavily on the language, hosting, and deployment target. Add them per project.
- **A `LICENSE` file at the root**: choosing a license is a per-project decision. The `licenses/` directory provides the candidates and `docs/LICENSE-GUIDE.md` explains how to choose.
- **Issue tracker automation, bots, org policies**: this template targets personal projects maintained by one person or a small team, not an organization.
