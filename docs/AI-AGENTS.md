# AI Agents Guidelines

How to set up a project so AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, and
similar) work well in it. The goal is one source of truth for agent
instructions, wired into each project from day one.

## The instruction files

| File | Read by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | growing cross-tool standard (many agents) | generic, tool-agnostic project instructions |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | Claude-specific entry point |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot | Copilot-specific entry point |

### Recommended layout: one source of truth

Write the real content once in `AGENTS.md`, and make tool-specific files thin
pointers to it:

```
# CLAUDE.md
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project instructions.
```

Claude Code also treats an `AGENTS.md` referenced this way as loaded context.
A symlink (`ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`) works too, if every environment you use
handles symlinks; the pointer file is the safer default. Duplicate actual
content across these files only as a last resort — it *will* drift.

## What belongs in AGENTS.md

Keep it short (a screenful or two) and factual. Agents read it on every
session; every line costs attention. Include:

- **What the project is** — one paragraph, plus the tech stack.
- **Commands** — how to build, test, lint, and run locally. Exact commands,
  not prose.
- **Conventions** — pointers to [COMMIT-CONVENTION.md](COMMIT-CONVENTION.md)
  and [BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md) rather than restating them.
- **Layout** — where source, tests, and docs live, if not obvious.
- **Boundaries** — what the agent must not do: files it must not edit
  (generated code, vendored deps), secrets locations, "never push to main",
  "never commit .env".

Leave out: long style guides (linters enforce those better), aspirational
process, anything already enforced by tooling, and anything you wouldn't tell
a new human contributor in their first hour.

### Skeleton to copy into new projects

```markdown
# <PROJECT_NAME>

[one-paragraph description and stack]

## Commands

- Build: [TO BE FILLED IN]
- Test: [TO BE FILLED IN]
- Lint: [TO BE FILLED IN]

## Conventions

- Commits: Conventional Commits — see docs/COMMIT-CONVENTION.md
- Branching: see docs/BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md
- All code, comments, and docs are written in English.

## Boundaries

- Never commit secrets; .env files are local-only.
- Do not edit [TO BE FILLED IN: generated/vendored paths].
```

## Init templates and generators

When a tool offers to generate its instruction file (e.g. Claude Code's `/init`
command), let it generate, then **merge the result into `AGENTS.md`** and reduce
the tool file to a pointer again. Generators are good at discovering commands
and layout, but the generated file should not become a second source of truth.

## Hygiene rules

- **Instruction files are code**: review changes to them in PRs like anything
  else, keep them in English, and update them when commands or layout change —
  a stale `AGENTS.md` is worse than none.
- **Never put secrets** or private URLs in instruction files; agents may echo
  them into logs, PRs, or third-party services.
- **Personal preferences stay local**: per-user agent config
  (e.g. `CLAUDE.local.md`, editor-level rules) is git-ignored, not committed.
- **Review agent output** like any contribution: agents follow this repo's
  contribution rules (commit convention, PR flow) — the human remains
  responsible for what gets merged.
- If the project has directory-specific rules, nested `AGENTS.md` files in
  subdirectories are supported by most tools and beat one giant root file.
